# Redux Counter with Persist

This project is a simple counter application built with React, Redux, and Redux Persist. It demonstrates the implementation of state management using Redux and the persistence of state across browser sessions using Redux Persist.

## Features

- Increment and decrement counter
- Reset counter to zero
- Persistent state (counter value is saved and restored on page reload)

## Technologies Used

- React
- Redux
- Redux Persist
- React Redux

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/redux-counter-persist.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd redux-counter-persist

3. Install dependencies:
npm install

4. Start the development server:
npm run dev

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Usage

- Click the "+" button to increment the counter
- Click the "-" button to decrement the counter
- Click the "Reset" button to set the counter back to zero
- Refresh the page to see that the counter value persists

## Learning Outcomes

This project was created to reinforce understanding of:

- Redux state management
- Action creators and reducers
- Redux store configuration
- Integration of Redux Persist for state persistence
- React and Redux connection using react-redux

## Future Improvements

- Add more complex state management scenarios
- Implement additional features to the counter (e.g., multiply, divide)
- Add unit tests for reducers and components
